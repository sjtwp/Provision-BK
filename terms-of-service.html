    <h2>Provision Bookkeeping LLC</h2>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 27, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:contact@provisionbk.com">contact@provisionbk.com</a></p>

    <p>Welcome to Provision Bookkeeping LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern the relationship between Provision Bookkeeping LLC and you, the client ("you" or "your"), regarding the bookkeeping, accounting, and related services ("Services") we provide. By engaging our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use our Services.</p>

    <h2>1. Services</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Scope of Services</h3>
    <p>Provision Bookkeeping LLC provides bookkeeping, financial record-keeping, and related administrative services as agreed upon in a separate engagement letter, service agreement, or as outlined on our website (<a href="http://provisionbk.com">provisionbk.com</a>). The specific scope of Services will be determined by mutual agreement and may include tasks such as maintaining ledgers, reconciling accounts, preparing financial reports, and other bookkeeping functions.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Limitations</h3>
    <p>We are not certified public accountants (CPAs) unless explicitly stated otherwise. Our Services do not include tax preparation, auditing, legal advice, or financial planning unless expressly agreed upon in writing. You are responsible for consulting qualified professionals for such services as needed.</p>

    <h2>2. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Provision of Information</h3>

    <h3>2.3 Compliance</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for ensuring that your business complies with all applicable laws, tax obligations, and regulations. We are not liable for any penalties or issues arising from your failure to comply.</p>

    <h2>3. Fees and Payment</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Fees</h3>
    <p>Our fees for Services will be outlined in a separate engagement letter, invoice, or as agreed upon in writing. Fees may be charged on an hourly, flat-rate, or subscription basis, depending on the nature of the Services.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Payment Terms</h3>
    <p>Invoices are due within 15 days of receipt unless otherwise specified. Payments can be made via bank transfer, check, or online payment portal. Late payments may incur a fee of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance or the maximum allowed by law, whichever is lower.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Changes to Fees</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to adjust our fees with 30 days’ written notice to you.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Data Security</h3>
    <p>We will take reasonable measures to protect your data, but we are not liable for breaches caused by third-party actions beyond our control (e.g., hacking of your systems).</p>

    <h2>5. Ownership and Records</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Client Ownership</h3>
    <p>All financial records and data you provide remain your property. Reports or deliverables we create for you as part of the Services are for your use and become your property upon full payment.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Our Records</h3>
    <p>We retain the right to keep internal copies of your records and our work product for our records, subject to our confidentiality obligations.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Termination by Us</h3>
    <p>We may terminate our Services for reasons including non-payment, failure to provide necessary information, or unethical conduct, with 30 days’ written notice, unless immediate termination is warranted.</p>

    <h3>6.4 Post-Termination</h3>
    <p>Upon termination, you are responsible for paying any outstanding fees for Services rendered. We will return or provide access to your records within a reasonable timeframe. After fulfilling our obligations to return or provide access to your records, we reserve the right to delete your information from our systems, except where retention is required by law.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    <h3>7.3 Reliance</h3>
    <p>You acknowledge that any financial reports or data we provide are based on the information you supply, and we are not responsible for errors or omissions in that information.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Provision Bookkeeping LLC, its employees, and agents from any claims, losses, or damages arising from your use of our Services, your breach of these Terms, or your failure to comply with applicable laws, except where such claims result from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

    <h3>9.2 Resolution Process</h3>
