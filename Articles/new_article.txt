Summary:
You own several commercial buildings, each in its own LLC, and everyone keeps telling you that you need a separate QuickBooks file for every property. You don’t. Here’s the professional standard used by most $10M–$150M portfolios, plus the exact step-by-step checklist to set it up correctly in a single QuickBooks file—cleanly, legally, and ready for taxes, lenders, or sale.

Section:The Myth That’s Costing You Time and Money
“Every LLC needs its own QuickBooks company” This is false for 95 % of private commercial owners. The IRS, your bank, and your CPA only care that you can produce accurate, separate financials per property/LLC. QuickBooks gives you exactly that with one built-in tool: Classes.

• Rule of thumb used by most successful owners:
– 1–12 properties → One QuickBooks file + Classes
– 12–30 properties → Still usually one file (or separate files + consolidation tool)
– 30+ or syndicated funds → Separate files or enterprise software (Yardi, MRI)

Section:Step-by-Step: How to Correctly Run Dozens of LLCs in ONE QuickBooks File
1. Create a single QuickBooks Online company (Plus or Advanced plan)
2. Turn on Class Tracking & Create one Class for each property/LLC
3. Open separate bank accounts, credit cards, and mortgage accounts for every LLC
4. Tag EVERY transaction with the correct Class. Rent checks, repair invoices, mortgage payments, insurance, property taxes, owner draws — all get the proper Class.
5. Run Profit & Loss AND Balance Sheet Statements by Class

Section:When You Will Actually Outgrow This Setup (It’s Not About Accounting)
• You want an online tenant portal (rent pay, maintenance requests, lease docs)
• You need automated late fees, 3-day notices, and text reminders
• You’re tracking large cap-ex projects with budgets and lien waivers
• You have 100+ tenants and need true batch processing

Popular upgrades at that stage: Buildium (20–150 units), AppFolio (50–1,000 units), Yardi Breeze or Voyager (500+ units or large commercial)

Section:The Only Times You Truly Need Separate QuickBooks Files
• Outside investors who must NEVER see the other properties (true syndication)
• One property has extremely complex operations (e.g., regional mall with percentage rent and food-court allocations)
• Separate EINs that run payroll through QuickBooks (rare in passive CRE)

Final: Final Summary: Stop Overcomplicating Your Books
One QuickBooks file + proper Class tracking + separate bank accounts per LLC is the method used by the majority of successful commercial owners with 2–20 properties.
You’ll save thousands in bookkeeping fees, cut your CPA prep time in half, and have sale-ready or refinance-ready financials at the click of a button.
Set it up correctly once, and your bookkeeping will run itself for the next decade—no matter how many buildings you add.
